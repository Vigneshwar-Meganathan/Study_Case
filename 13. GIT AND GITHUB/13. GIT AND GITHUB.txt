GIT AND GITHUB 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIT:
   Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
GITHUB:
   GitHub is a web-based cloud service to host your source code(Git repositories). It is a centralized system.
   Git doesn’t require GitHub but GitHub requires Git.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIT AND GITHUB:

GIT COMMAND:
   git clone
   git add
   git status 
   git push 
   git pull
   git commit
   git reset
   git merge
   git rebase

GIT CLONE: 
   The git clone command all the files are downloaded to the local machine but the remote git repository. Making changes and commit them into local repository will not affect the 
   remote repository. These changes made on the local machine can be synced with the remote repository anytime the user wants.
GIT ADD:
   The git add command is used to add the current content and it will track that file.
   Command Line: git add .\filename.txt (Ex: Enter the file name)
GIT COMMIT:
   The git commit is the continuous of git add command once we track the code using the commit command it will add in local repository.
   Command Line: git commit -m "MSG" (MSG- Reason for commiting the code and changes to be mentioned)
GIT STATUS:
   The git status command help in which branch we are located and how many commits has been done and display the msg of the commit.
   Command Line: git status
GIT PUSH:
   The Git push help to upload the code to the github repository
   Command Line: git push
GIT PULL:
   The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
   Command Line: git pull
MERGE CONFLICT:
   The merge conflict occurs when we downloading the remote repository data to the local repository any type of value or msg is defferent it will through the merge conflict error.
   For Example:
   a = 1
   b = 2
   <<<<<<<< HEAD
   c = 3
   ==============
   c = 45
   >>>>>>>>>>>4456544545874bc878a
   d = 4
   we can set which value or command we need. This way we get the merge conflict error.
GIT RESET:
   The git reset is used to reset the commit for example we had nearly 10 commits but i don't need the last 3 commit the last commit should be a 7 commit so using this git reset we can
   remove the those 3 commit. Every commits had their unique identity number <commit hash> using that we can rest.
   Command Line: git reset--hard <commit hash>
GIT MERGE:
   Is a non-destructive operation
   Existing branches are not changed in any way
   Creates a new merge commit in the feature branch   
   Before commanding the merge checkout which branch are we.
   This Merge it will create a new commit for the git merge.
   Command Line: git merge mater 
GIT REBASE:
   Moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch
   Re-writes the project history
   We get much cleaner and linear project histo  
   Before commanding the merge checkout which branch are we.
   Rebase will not create the commit. Just it will add on tip of master.
   Command Line: git rebase master 
PULL REQUEST:
   A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project.
   A pull request occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project’s main repository.
