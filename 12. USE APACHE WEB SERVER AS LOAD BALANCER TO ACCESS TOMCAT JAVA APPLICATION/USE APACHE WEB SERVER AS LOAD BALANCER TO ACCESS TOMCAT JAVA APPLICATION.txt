USE APACHE WEB SERVER AS LOAD BALANCER TO ACCESS TOMCAT JAVA APPLICATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOD_JK:
	The mod_jk connector is an Apache HTTPD module that allows HTTPD to communicate with Apache Tomcat instances over the AJP protocol.  
	The module is used in conjunction with Tomcat's AJP Connector component.
	Apache Tomcat uses Connector components to allow communication between a Tomcat instance and another party, 
	 such as a browser, server, or another Tomcat instance that is part of the same network.
	Using the AJP connector, Apache Tomcat instances can exchange data with mod_jk enabled instances of Apache HTTPD, using the AJP protocol.
AJP PROTOCAL:
   AJP Connectors are most commonly implemented in Tomcat through the plug-in technology mod_jk, a re-write of the defunct mod_jserv plug-in with extensive optimization, 
    support for more protocols through the jk library, and Tomcat-specific functionality.

   Copy that mok_jk file to the below path:
   PATH: C:\Apache24\modules
TOMCAT SERVER SERVER.XML FILE:
   Now we need to set the AJP ports for all 3 instance tomcat1, tomcat2, tomcat3 given below path.
    PATH: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat Instance 1\conf
    PATH: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat Instance 2\conf
    PATH: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat Instance 3\conf
   Now we need to unmound the command and set the ajp port.
    For Example: 
	<Connector protocol="AJP/1.3"
               port="8109"
               redirectPort="8141"  secretRequired=""/>	
    <Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="tomcat1">  
	(Tomcat1 name of the instance 1)
	Like the same need to update on all 3 instance and save it.
EDIT ON APACHE WEB SERVER:
   At the last we need to wirte the command line to mount the Mod_jk file command given below and save it.
   Command Line:
     LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so

	 JkWorkersFile conf/workers.properties

	 JkMount  /* balancer 
	 JkMount  /status  stat
