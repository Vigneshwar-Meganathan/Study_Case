EXPLORE TOMCAT AND COMPONENTS [CLUSTER, CATALINA JASPER AND COYOTE] 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEB SERVER: {TOMCAT}
   The web server is the responsible to run the web application.
   The web server handles only static page [html, image file. etc]
WEB CONTAINER:
   The web container is part of web server. [stand alone web container]
   The web container is the resposible to manage and excute the servlet and jsp.
   It contains to container server container (servlet engine), Jsp container (Jsp engine)
Servlet Container: [CATALINA] 
   It responsible for manage and excute the servlet lifecycle.
Jsp [Java Server Page] Container: [JASPER]
   It responsible for manage and excute jsp components.

COYOTE:
   COYOTE is a connector for Tomcat that supports the HTTP 1.1 protocal as a web server.
   This allows CATALINA, nnominally a java servlet or jsp container to also act as a plain web severr that serves local files as HTTP documents.
   COYOTE listens for the incommin connections to the server a on a specfic TCP port and forwards the request to the TOMCAT engine to process the request and  
    send back a response to the requesting client.
   [OR]
    Coyote listens for incoming connections on configured TCP ports on the server and forwards requests to the Tomcat Engine for processing 
	 and returning a response to the requesting client.
CLUSTER:
   Tomcat clustering is a group of Tomcat instances that are connected. An instance of Tomcat is an independent system. 
   Clustering instances of Tomcat makes them interconnected.
   Cluster can provide faster processing speed, larger storage capacity, better data integrity, greater reliability and wider availability of resources.
   It helps in load balancing, high availability, high performance or large-scale processing.
