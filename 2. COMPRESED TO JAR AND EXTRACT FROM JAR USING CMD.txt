COMPRESED TO JAR AND EXTRACT FROM JAR USING CMD

Need to Archive the .JAVA file to .JAR file:
   First check the path of the .java file then create the notepad file manifest.txt
    MANIFIEST.TXT: The manifest is a special file that can contain information about the files packaged in a JAR file. By tailoring 
	this "meta" information that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file to serve a variety of purposes.
   Now we just open the manifest.txt file and type main-class: Nameofthejavafile (ex file:test.java) [main-class: test]
   After that open the cmd 
    cd choose the path folder of the java file and manifest text file
	then run the command javac test.java you will get the .class file 
	the right the command jar cfn test.jar manifest.txt test.class

	Now you witll get the test.jar file.
	
Now need to run the jar file using cmd and get the output:
   Just right click the .jar file and open archive you will see two file one is META-INF and .class file
   if you run the jar file in cmd error: manifest attribute error with occur like class error.
   So we need to edit on the META-INF folder manifest.mf file just drag and drop the manifest.mf file to the local 
   And edit with notepad++ just add in second line main-class: Nameofthejavafile (ex file:GFG.class) [main-class: GFG] and replace the file in same path.
