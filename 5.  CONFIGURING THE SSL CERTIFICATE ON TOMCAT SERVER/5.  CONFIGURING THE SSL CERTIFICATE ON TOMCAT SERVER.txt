CONFIGURING THE SSL CERTIFICATE ON TOMCAT SERVER AND ACCESS THE APPLICATION THROUGH HTTS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How HTTPS works:
   HTTPS is a Hypertext Transfer Protocal Secure is mostly usefull for online transcation and e-shopping it will keeps the user datas secured.
   For example we are searching www.sbi.com form our pc it will send the request to the www.sbi.com server for secure connection.
   From server it will send the pubic key attached with digital certificated then it will check wheather the cerficate is valid.
   Then it will generate the Symentric key and one  copy of the symentic key will encrptyed and send to the server.
   In the server there will be a private key using that it will decrypt that symentic key.
   Now Pc and sever both have the same symentic key and they communicate each other by encrpt and decrypt the datas throught the HTTPS.

STEP 1:
   we need to create the .cert file using cmd locate the local path and we need write the command 
   path:D:\SSL
   In cmd: keytool -genkeypair -alias Mycert -keyalg RSA -keystore "D:\SSL\Mycert.cert"
   After that it will ask the password location details.
   then the .cert created.
STEP 2:
   Need to change the SSL path and password so go to the tomcat installation path 
   path: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\conf
   There will be a server.xml file 
   We need to replace this code
    <Connector SSLEnabled="true" acceptCount="100" clientAuth="false"
    disableUploadTimeout="true" enableLookups="false" maxThreads="25"
    port="8443" keystoreFile="D:\SSL\Mycert.cert" keystorePass="pass123"
    protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" scheme="https"
    secure="true" sslProtocol="TLS" />
	Save the xml file and restart the service. 
	Go to the browers and run https://local:8443
STEP 3: 
   If we are going to run the web application 
   Just go to the web.xml file and paste the below code
      <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
        <web-resource-name>securedapp</web-resource-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <user-data-constraint>
        <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
STEP 4: 
   Deploy the .war file.
